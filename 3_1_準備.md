### RISK MANAGEMENT ROLES
### リスク管理の役割 ###

**TASK P-1**  
**タスク P-1**: Identify and assign individuals to　specific roles associated with security and privacy risk management.  
セキュリティおよびプライバシーのリスク管理に関連する特定の役割を明確化し、適切な担当者を割り当てる。  

**Potential Inputs**: Organizational security and privacy policies and procedures; organizational charts.  
**潜在的な入力情報**：組織のセキュリティおよびプライバシーに関する方針および手順、組織図。

**Expected Outputs**: Documented Risk Management Framework role assignments.  
**期待される成果物**：リスク管理フレームワークにおける役割の割り当てを文書化したもの。

**Primary Responsibility**: Head of Agency; Chief Information Officer; Senior Agency Official for Privacy.  
**主な責任者**：機関の長、最高情報責任者（Chief Information Officer）、プライバシー担当上級機関職員（Senior Agency Official for Privacy）


**Supporting Roles**: Authorizing Official or Authorizing Official Designated Representative; Senior Accountable Official for Risk Management or Risk Executive (Function); Senior Agency Information Security Officer.  
**支援役割**：承認権限者またはその指定代理人、リスク管理担当上級責任者またはリスクエグゼクティブ（機能）、機関情報セキュリティ責任者（Senior Agency Information Security Officer）

**Discussion**: The roles and responsibilities of key participants in risk management processes are described in Appendix D. The roles and responsibilities may include personnel that are internal or external to the organization, as appropriate. Since organizations have different missions, functions, and organizational structures, there may be differences in naming conventions for risk management roles and how specific responsibilities are allocated among organizational personnel (e.g., multiple individuals filling a single role or one individual filling multiple roles). In either situation, the basic risk management functions remain the same. Organizations ensure that there are no conflicts of interest when assigning the same individual to multiple risk management roles. For example, authorizing officials cannot occupy the role of system owner or common control provider for systems or common controls they are authorizing. In addition, combining multiple roles for security and privacy requires care because the two disciplines may require different expertise, and in some circumstances, the priorities may be competing. Some roles may be allocated to a group or an office rather than to an individual, for example, control assessor, risk executive (function), or system administrator.  
**議論**：リスク管理プロセスに関与する主要な関係者の役割と責任については、付録Dで説明されている。これらの役割には、組織内の者だけでなく、必要に応じて外部の関係者が含まれる場合もある。組織の使命や機能、構造は多様であるため、リスク管理上の役割の名称や、誰にどの責任を割り当てるかという点については組織ごとに異なることがある（例：一つの役割を複数名で分担する、一人が複数の役割を兼任する、など）。  
いずれの場合でも、果たすべきリスク管理機能の基本は変わらない。  
複数のリスク管理上の役割を同一人物に割り当てる際は、利益相反が生じないようにする必要がある。たとえば、ある人物が承認権限者である場合、自身が認可するシステムまたは共通コントロールに対して、そのシステムオーナーや共通コントロール提供者の役割を兼ねることはできない。  
さらに、セキュリティとプライバシーの役割を統合する場合、それぞれが異なる専門知識を必要とし、状況によっては優先事項が競合する可能性があるため、注意が求められる。  
また、役割の一部は個人ではなく、部門やグループ単位で割り当てられることもある（例：コントロール評価者、リスクエグゼクティブ（機能）、システム管理者など）。

### RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

**TASK P-2**  
  Establish a risk management strategy for the organization that includes a determination of risk tolerance.  

**Potential Inputs**: Organizational missionstatement; organizational policies; organizational risk assumptions, constraints, priorities and trade-offs.  

**Expected Outputs**: Risk management strategy and statement of risk tolerance inclusive of information security and privacy risk.  

**Primary Responsibility**: Head of Agency.  

**Supporting Roles**: Senior Accountable Official for Risk Management or Risk Executive (Function); Chief Information Officer; Senior Agency Information Security Officer; Senior Agency Official for Privacy.  

**Discussion**: Risk tolerance is the degree of risk or uncertainty that is acceptable to an organization. Risk tolerance affects all parts of the organization’s risk management process, having a direct impact on the risk management decisions made by senior leaders or executives throughout the organization and providing important constraints on those decisions. The risk management strategy guides and informs risk-based decisions including how security and privacy risk is framed, assessed, responded to, and monitored. The risk management strategy may be composed of a single document, or separate securityand privacy risk management documents.54 The risk management strategy makes explicit the threats, assumptions, constraints, priorities, trade-offs, and risk tolerance used for making investment and operational decisions. This strategy includes the strategic-level decisions and considerations for how senior leaders and executives are to manage security and privacy risks (including supply chain risks) to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The risk management strategy includes an expression of organizational risk tolerance; acceptable risk assessment methodologies and risk response strategies; a process for consistently evaluating security and privacy risks organization-wide; and approaches for monitoring risk over time. As organizations define and implement the risk management strategies, policies, procedures, and processes, it is important that they include SCRM considerations. The risk management strategy for security and privacy connects security and privacy programs with the management control systems established in the organization’s Enterprise Risk Management strategy.55

### RISK ASSESSMENT—ORGANIZATION
**TASK P-3**  
  Assess organization-wide security and privacy risk and update the risk assessment results on an ongoing basis.  

**Potential Inputs**: Risk management strategy; mission or business objectives; current threat information;  system-level security and privacy risk assessment results; supply chain risk assessment results; previous organization-level security and privacy risk assessment results; information sharing agreements or memoranda of understanding; security and privacy information from continuous monitoring.  

**Expected Outputs**: Organization-level risk assessment results.  

**Primary Responsibility**: Senior Accountable Official for Risk Management or Risk Executive (Function); Senior Agency Information Security Officer; Senior Agency Official for Privacy.  

**Supporting Roles**: Chief Information Officer; Mission or Business Owner; Authorizing Official or Authorizing Official Designated Representative.  

**Discussion**: Risk assessment at the organizational level leverages aggregated information from system-level risk assessment results, continuous monitoring, and any strategic risk considerations relevant to the organization. The organization considers the totality of risk from the operation and use of its information systems, from information exchange and connections with other internally and externally owned systems,and from the use of external providers. For example, the organization may review the risk related to its enterprise architecture and information systems of varying impact levels residing on the same network and whether higher impact systems are segregated from lower impact systems or systems operated and maintained by external providers. The organization may also consider the variability of environments that may exist within the organization (e.g., different locations serving different missions/business processes) and the need to account for such variability in risk assessments. Risk assessments of the organization’s supply chain may be conducted as well. Risk assessment results may be used to help organizations establish a Cybersecurity Framework Profile.

### ORGANIZATIONALLY-TAILORED CONTROL BASELINES AND CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK PROFILES (Optional)  

**TASK P-4**  
  Establish, document, and publish organizationally-tailored control baselines and/or Cybersecurity Framework Profiles.  

**Potential Inputs**: Documented security and privacy requirements directing the use of　organizationally-tailored control baselines; mission or business objectives; enterprise architecture; security architecture; privacy architecture; organization- and system-level risk assessment results; list of common control providers and common controls available for inheritance; NIST Special Publication 800-53B control baselines.56  

Expected Outputs: List of approved or directed organizationally-tailored control baselines; [NIST CSF] Profiles.  

Primary Responsibility: Mission or Business Owner; Senior Accountable Official for Risk Management or Risk Executive (Function).  

Supporting Roles: Chief Information Officer; Authorizing Official or Authorizing Official Designated Representative; Senior Agency Information Security Officer; Senior Agency Official for Privacy.  

Discussion: To address the organizational mission or business need for specialized sets of controls to reduce risk, organizationally-tailored control baselines may be developed for organization-wide use.57 An organizationally-tailored baseline provides a fully specified set of controls, control enhancements, and supplemental guidance derived from established control baselines described in [SP 800-53B]. The tailoring process can also be guided and informed by the requirements engineering process described in [SP 800-160 v1]. Organizations can use the tailored control baseline concept when there is divergence from the specific assumptions used to create the initial control baselines in [SP 800-53B]. This would include, for example, situations when the organization has specific security or privacy risks, has specific mission or business needs, or plans to operate in environments that are not addressed in the initial baselines.
Organizationally-tailored baselines and overlays complement the NIST control baselines by providing an opportunity to add or eliminate controls to accommodate organizational requirements while continuing to protect information commensurate with risk. Organizations can use tailored baselines and overlays to 
customize control baselines by describing control applicability and by providing interpretations for specific technologies; types of missions or business functions, operations, systems, environments of operation, and operating modes; and statutory or regulatory requirements. Multiple customized baselines may be useful for organizations with heterogeneous systems (e.g., organizations that maintain systems with different operating or processing characteristics, or mission or business characteristics).
Organizationally-tailored baselines can establish organization-defined control parameter values for assignment or selection statements in controls and control enhancements that are agreeable to specific communities of interest and can also extend the supplemental guidance where necessary. Tailoredbaselines may be more stringent or less stringent than the baselines identified in [SP 800-53B] and areapplied to multiple systems.
Tailored baselines developed outside the organization may also be mandated for use by certain laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, or standards. In some situations, tailoring actions may be restricted or limited by the developer of the tailored baseline or by the issuing authority for the 
tailored baseline. Tailored baselines (or overlays) have been developed by communities of interest for cloud and shared systems, services, and applications; industrial control systems; privacy; national security systems; weapons and space-based systems; high value assets;58 mobile device management; federal public key infrastructure; and privacy risks.
Organizations may also benefit from developing one or more Cybersecurity Framework Profiles. A Cybersecurity Framework Profile uses the Subcategories in the Framework Core to align cybersecurity outcomes with mission or business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources of the organization.59 The prioritized list of cybersecurity outcomes developed at the organization and mission/business process levels can be helpful in facilitating consistent, risk-based decisions at the system level. The Subcategories identified in the applicable Cybersecurity Framework Profiles can also be used to guide and inform the development of the tailored control baselines described above.
